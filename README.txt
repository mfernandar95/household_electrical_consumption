- Introduction
This project consists on analysing https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption dataset. The behaviour of features as power and energy will be analysed throughout time in order to check if there are seasonality, stationarity and a trend.
The EDA, trend andthe prediction in time is contained in the same file.
The dataset is downloaded as the code runs.

- Technology
Python 3.7
Jupyter Notebook

- Run
To run it you have to clone the repository or download the file and run it on an environment that contains Python 3.7.



At this repository we have one file:
data_analysis.ipynb - (Jupyter notebook): this file contains the exploratory data analysis and the modeling as well.
